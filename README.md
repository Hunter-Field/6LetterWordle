# 6LetterWordle

This project replicates the popular game "Wordle" to now have 6 letters to guess instead of 5.

This version allows the user to enter the number of tries they want but otherwise follows the same rules as the original.

The file "WorkingTest" was the first functional version of the game before I optimized and polished up the code.
