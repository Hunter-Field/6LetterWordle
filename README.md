# 6LetterWordle

This project replicates the popular game "Wordle" but with 6 letter words instead of 5.

This version allows the user to enter the number of tries they want but otherwise follows the same rules as the original.

The file "WorkingTest" was the first functional version of the game before I optimized and polished up the code. I also
tried my best to get the final version, just named "Wordle" under 100 lines of code, and was successful.
